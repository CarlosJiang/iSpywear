# iSpyWear2

A Research Project to find if side channels on smartphones like Motion Sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope etc.,) can reveal tap events such as a smartphone user typing his/her PIN.

The Project involves two parts,
1. Uses an Android Application for accelerometer data collection.
2. The collected data is used to train an algorithm using Machine Learning tools such as scikit and numPy.
